Title: Practical assessment

About: To make this course also more interesting and to give you some practical experience,
we are going to use everything from course in practice.
We will start with Spring boot application and later on we will add new technologies and stuff that we are learning.
Later on persistence layer and also UI as Angular 6 or 7.

Subjects: Java, Spring boot, Tomcat

Test: Make simple rest spring boot application (version 2.1.3.) with Java 9,
it should have 1 endpoint date/getDate. When you call that endpoint the result should be current date and time.
Response should be in JSON format. You can use Maven or Gradle, but if you are very familiar with maven,
that I would like from you to do it using Gradle.
After finishing, upload one copy of project to SVN and another to GiT.
After that send me links in email.

Request: get localhost:8080/date/getDate

Response: date: “10/4/2019”,
	     time:  ”11:54”

Time: 3-5 days
